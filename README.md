# Spam_Mail_Prediction-ML
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to detect spam emails. Implemented in Google Colab, it preprocesses email text, extracts features with TF-IDF, and trains the model on a labeled dataset. The model evaluates accuracy and recall, successfully classifying spam from non-spam emails, enabling efficient email filtering.
