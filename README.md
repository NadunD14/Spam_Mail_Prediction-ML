<h1>Spam Email Detection Using Logistic Regression</h1>

Project Description: This project aims to detect spam emails using a machine learning approach. Logistic Regression, a popular classification algorithm, was employed to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. The project was implemented in Google Colab, taking advantage of its cloud-based environment for efficient computation.

Steps Undertaken:

1) Dataset Acquisition:
A publicly available email dataset (e.g., the SpamAssassin dataset or a similar dataset) was utilized. The dataset contained labeled examples of both spam and non-spam emails.

2) Data Preprocessing:

- Text Cleaning: Removed unnecessary elements like special characters, HTML tags, and stopwords from the email content.
- Feature Extraction: Used techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to convert text data ---- into numerical features.
 
3) Model Training:

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20%).
- Trained a Logistic Regression model to classify emails based on extracted features.

4) Evaluation:

- Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Ensured the model had a good balance between identifying spam emails (True Positives) and avoiding misclassifying legitimate emails (False Positives).
- 
5) Deployment (Optional):

- Demonstrated predictions for real-time email content to test the model’s robustness.
  
Technologies Used:

- Programming Language: Python
- Platform: Google Colab
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK (or Spacy), Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
Outcome:  
The project successfully created a spam email detection system with a Logistic Regression model, achieving high accuracy and recall rates. The insights from this project can be extended to improve email filtering systems for businesses or personal use.
